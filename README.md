# SURVEY FORM WITH RESPONSIVE DESIGN 

## Description
A survey form for a programming course. The language of the form is Spanish, but the "<html>" and "<css>" documents are written in English for the general understanding of the code.
  
 Among the "HTML" tools that were used, there are the different inputs: text, radio buttos, checkboxes, dropdowns, textarea and submit button. <br>
 On the "CSS" side, media queries were used to achieve a responsive design, which can be displayed on mobiles, tables and desktops.
